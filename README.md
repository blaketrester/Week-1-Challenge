# Week 1 Challenge 

## Horiseon Website Code Refactor

**Goal**
My primary goal in this project was to practice and gain important experience refactoring website code to better fit semantic HTML and meet accessibilty standards. I made sure to use the "Boy Scout's Motto" by leaving it cleaner and much more accessible than how I found it ensuring a more efficient website from code to UI.

**Revisions**
- I was able to reorganize many elements of the CSS Stylesheet by consoladating tags and selectors throughout the file for a cleaner, easier to read presentation. I also grouped similar styles together and organized them by selectors and page elements. 

- There were several tasks I was able to accomplish in the HTML file to make it stringer and more decisive website. Not all of the links were working correctly, so I was able to add the appropriate IDs to ensure proper functionality. The replaced the title because it read "website" and I determined that "Horiseon" would have more of an impact in it's place. I added alt image attributes because they were all missing any alt text and this was would be necessary for proper accessibility. I replaced all none descriptive tags with semantic HTML to with accessibility and search engine optimization.

- I finished off my changes by adding comments to both the HTML page and the Stylesheet making everything easier read as well as making elements easier to find in the files. This will also help anyone who would like to work on this project in the future.
